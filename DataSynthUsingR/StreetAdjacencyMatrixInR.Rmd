A street adjacency matrix $M$ is the mathematical representation of the connectivity (relationships) between the segments of a street network. In geographical data analysis, it might be important to know which segments (edges) in a network are connected to one another, in order to model the propagation of a geographical phenomenon such as crime risk or traffic flow across the network. The adjacency matrix ($n \times n$) provides a simple way of defining such connectivity with an entry "1" for any pair of segments that are directly connected to the same node, and "0" if they are not. Figure 1 is an example of an adjacency matrix of a network comprising seven segments.
